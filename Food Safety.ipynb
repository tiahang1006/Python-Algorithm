    "2. `count non null`: The number of present values for the zip code.\n",
    "3. `fraction null`: The fraction of values that are null for the zip code.\n",

From examining the first few rows of `ins`, we see that `type` takes string value, one of which is `'routine'`, presumably for a routine inspection. What other values does the inspection `type` take? How many occurrences of each value is in `ins`? What can we tell about these values? Can we use them for further analysis? If so, how?\n",

Make a bar plot of the counts of the number of inspections receiving each score. \n",

It should be exactly the same as `ins`, except that it should have the name and address of every business, as determined by the `bus` dataframe. If a `business_id` in `ins` does not exist in `bus`, the name and address should be given as NaN.\n",

    "Another way to compare the scores from the two inspections is to examine the difference in scores. Subtract the first score from the second in `scores_pairs_by_business`. Make a histogram of these differences in the scores. We might expect these differences to be positive, indicating an improvement from the first to the second inspection.\n",
